Output:
$bm.fn1: all function names are translated to human readable format

Match:

Input: bm1=Benchmark1 bm2=Benchmark2

python match.py $bm1.fn1 $bm2.fn1 <src-$bm1> <src-$bm2>

Output:
A sequence of matched functions with their instruction count. 
The sequence is sorted in decreasing order of difference.
